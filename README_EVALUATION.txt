# Getting Started

The software artifact is packaged as an Open Virtual Appliance (.ova) file
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format] with Xubuntu 21.04.

The credentials are:
username: pldi22-reviewer
password: pldi22ae

The synthesis tool can be found in `/home/pldi22-reviewer/Synduce`. Note that the
tool is named Sebis in the paper for anonimity reasons, and the artifact builds
upon and extends the tool Synduce. In this artifact, we use the name Synduce for
the tool.

To get started, open a terminal and change directory to the root folder of the tool
`/home/pldi22-reviewer/Synduce`.
The tool has already been compiled, but the README.md in the tool directory contains
general instructions on how to build the tool and run it.
We have prepared a script for the reviewers to use to check that the installation is
working as expected.
Running the following command:

`./0-kick-the-tires.sh`

Runs the tool on a small set of 24 benchmarks. All benchmarks should pass. All
benchmarks have a solution, except the last one.
The last line of the output should look like:

âœ… All 24 benchmarks passed in 3.9 s.

Naturally, the running time may vary, but it should be within 10s.
The reviewer cam also run the tool on individual benchmarks, for example:

$ ./Synduce benchmarks/constraints/bst/count_lt.ml

Should print a solution in less than a second.

# Step-by-step Instructions

This section contains step-by-step instructions to reproduce the results presented
in the paper. More precisely, we provide instruction to reproduce:
- the sequence of calls to the tool described in Section 2 that leads the programmer to find a
  solution for the problem of optimizing the count-between function on binary search trees.
- the experimental results that are presented in Section 8 in Figures 3 and 4. These results are
  repeated in Appendix C.2 and C.3 in table form (Table 1 and 2).

## Reproducing the example of Section 2

The benchmarks corresponding to the different versions of the sketch for the
`countbtw` example have been grouped in the folder
`benchmarks/count_between_example/`. There are 4 different unrealizable benchmarks,
and 1 realizable one. At each step, the reviewer can check that:
- the tool answers unrealizable or realizable,
- the tool provides useful feedback to the user: either a solution or an input and an
indication of which branch of the sketch needs to be fixed.

1) The first example (`benchmarks/count_between_example/1.ml`) is the first instantiation of the
problem presented in Section 2. The reference function and the target recursion skeleton are
the ones given on page 3.
This problem is unrealizable, there is no solution to the
sketch.
Running the tool on that benchmark:
$ ./Synduce benchmarks/count_between_example/1.ml
The tool should give a hint as to why it is unrealizable.
The reviewer should expect an answer within 1s, and the before-last line of the output should be:
>  "On input Node(i, p, p0), g1 should have access to g p0"

2) The second example is the instance where the programmer has fixed the input of g1
given the information returned by the tool.
The problem is still unrealizable:
$ ./Synduce benchmarks/count_between_example/2.ml
The reviewer should expect an answer within 1s, and the before-last line of the output should be:
> "On input Node(i, p, p0), g2 should have access to g p"

3) In the third example, the inputs of g1 and g2 have been fixed.
The problem is still unrealizable. A quick answer can be obtained using the Symbolic CEGIS
algorithm:
$ ./Synduce benchmarks/count_between_example/3.ml --segis
The tool answers that the benchmark is unrealizable within a second.
To get a more detailed answer, run:
$ ./Synduce benchmarks/count_between_example/3.ml
The tool produces the following hint in less than a minute:
> "On input Node(i, p, p0), g3 should have access to g p"

4) In the fourth example, the programmer added (g l) as an argument to g3.
Running
$ ./Synduce benchmarks/count_between_example/4.ml --segis
produce the "unrealizable" answer in less than a second.
Running
$ ./Synduce benchmarks/count_between_example/4.ml
produces and answer with arguably more useful information in about 4min (the tool
has to discover many invariants):
> "On input Node(i, p, p0), g3 should have access to g p0"

5) In the fifth example, the programmer added (g r) as an argument to g3.
The problem is realizable.
Running
$ ./Synduce benchmarks/count_between_example/5.ml
produces a solution in less than a second (the solution should include a definition
for the functions g0, g1, g2, g3).
